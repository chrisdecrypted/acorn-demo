    <h1>Acorn 130 Stairlift</h1>
    <h2>A Great Stair Lift for Straight Staircases</h2>

<p>In this video, we demonstrate the safe and proper use of the Acorn 130 stairlift.</p>

<p>
The Acorn 130 Stairlift is one of the most advanced and widely used stairlifts in the world, helping hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to safely and comfortably use their stairs and enjoy their homes again.
</p>
<p>
Every aspect of the Acorn 130 Stairlift has been designed to the highest standards of comfort and safety. Our years of experience have helped us to create a stairlift that is built purely with the end-user in mind.
</p>
<p>
The Acorn 130 Stairlift is powered by a maintenance-free DC powered battery pack, which ensures uninterrupted use, even in the event of a power outage.
With a built-in soft start and stop mechanism, the Acorn 130 provides a smooth and comfortable ride every time.
</p>
<p>
Another feature pioneered by Acorn is the on-board diagnostic control panel which alerts you to any potential problems before they arise, (e.g. the stairlift has accidentally been switched off or incorrectly parked).
</p>
<p>
The Acorn 130 Stairlift has also earned the prestigious Ease- of-Use Commendation from the Arthritis Foundation, further proving how safe, comfortable and easy to use it is. When not in use, the Acorn 130 folds up, nice and easy, so that everyone can continue to use the stairs.
